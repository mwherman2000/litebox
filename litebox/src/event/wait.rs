//! Support infrastructure for interruptible waits.
//!
//! Ordinary waits in litebox, via the [`RawMutex`] trait, are not easily
//! interrupted--they can only be woken up by another thread explicitly
//! signaling the raw mutex. This is fine for ordinary uses of mutexes, locks,
//! and condition variables, cases where waits can be guaranteed to eventually
//! complete.
//!
//! However, waits on guest- or externally-controlled conditions (e.g., futexes,
//! eventfds, IO events) must be interruptible due to process termination or
//! asynchronous signals, since the waited-on event may never occur. This module
//! provides infrastructure for handling such cases.
//!
//! The core type is [`WaitState`], which models a per-thread wait state. The
//! thread can create a [`WaitContext`] from the wait state, which can then be
//! used to perform interruptible waits on a given condition. The wait context
//! produces a [`Waker`], which can be passed to other threads to wake up the
//! waiting thread. And finally, the wait state can produce a [`ThreadHandle`],
//! which can be used to interrupt the thread in any state, whether it is
//! waiting or running guest code.
