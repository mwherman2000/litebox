//! A multiplexer for [LiteBox platforms](../litebox/platform/index.html), to simplify access to a
//! global platform for shims "above" LiteBox.
//!
//! At a high level, due to Rust language design decisions, supporting a **global**
//! runtime-parametric platform is not quite directly feasible. In particular, either
//! platform-dependent functionality either needs to be aware of the platform, or each function
//! would need a parametric platform, neither of which is ideal. This crate side-steps that by using
//! conditional compilation (at this single crate) to provide the necessary switching between
//! platforms.
//!
//! Specifically, a platform MUST be selected via one of the features provided by this crate (and
//! cannot be provided dynamically at run-time). However, crates above it can then work with a
//! global platform _without_ needing to deal with any such switching. If a LiteBox platform exists
//! that does not have a corresponding feature in this crate, support for it is easy to add.
//!
//! By default, this crate picks the Linux userland platform.

extern crate alloc;

// Checking if more than one of the platforms has been specified. If so, compiler error.
//
// NOTE: Currently, we only support one platform, thus this is a trivial no-op. However, once we
// have more, we must account for each of the possible pairs.
